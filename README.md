This python code takes in patients details, and stores them into two seperate file 'patients.txt' and 'vaccination.txt'.

'vaccination.txt' stores general patient details which can be viewed majority of the vaccination team while 'patients.txt' stores more sensative data which can be viewed by authorized personal.

Upon entering the patients age the system will promt us with the vaccines that they are elligible to take, while patients under the age of 11 will be not allowed to take the vaccine.k.
Note - to ensure the app runs, please ensure vaccination.txt, patients.txt and the python code are within the same folder.
